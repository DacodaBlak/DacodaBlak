Hi, I’m @DacodaBlak
Born & raised in The Bronx.
I come from a family of intellectually organized hustlers.
Out the gate my goal was to continue the family business.
Fast forward and my husband is convicted of RICO and is sentenced to multiple life sentences.
Once I re-emerged, I was introduced to coding/programming. It changed my life and my perspective on many issues.
Now I want to introduce you to a new way, a new tool, a new perspective that has been here right under our noses, right in front of our ojos.

It’s Time To Evolve.
Let’s Learn Some Shit!
